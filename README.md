# PySDtest

 A Python Package for Stochastic Dominance Tests

PySDtest is a Python 3 implementation of routines for Stochastic Dominance tests. This package was created by Kyungho Lee in collaboration with Yoon-Jae Whang.

This package implements stochastic dominance tests proposed by [Barrett and Donald (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00390), [Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v72y2005i3p735-765.html), [Linton, Song and Whang (2010)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeeconom/v_3a154_3ay_3a2010_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a186-202.htm), [Donald and Hsu (2014)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07474938.2013.833813). For details of each model, refer to corresponding paper.
