Testing for Stochastic Dominance with Python

PySD is a Python 3 implementation of routines for Stochastic Dominance tests. This package was created by Kyungho LEE in collaboration with Yoon-Jae Whang.

This package implements stochastic dominance tests proposed by Barrett and Donald (2003), Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005), Linton, Song and Whang (2010), Donald and Hsu (2014). For details of each model, refer to corresponding paper.
