    options               Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Main

      by                  Specify a binary variable for dividing the sample. If the option by( ) is not
                            given, there must be two (continuous) variables for performing testing.

      switch              Whether to switch an order of the sample when the option by( ) is specified.

      resampling          Specify a resampling method. The method must be one of "bootstrap",
                            "subsampling", or "paired_bootstrap". If the option is not given, "bootstrap"
                            is used as a default option.  To use "subsampling", the number of subsample t
                            and second variables must be given by options b1( ) and b2( ), respectively.
                            To use "paired_bootstrap", variables need to be arranged in a correct pair and
                            have the same number of observations.

      approach            Specify a testing method. If the option is not given, Kolmogorov-Smirnov type
                            test statistic is used as in Barrett and Donald (2003) and Linton et al.
                            (2005). If "contact" is given, the contact set approach by Linton et al.  is
                            performed. If "SR" is given, the selective recentering approach by Donald and
                            Hsu (2016) is performed. If "NDM" is given, the numerical delta method is
                            performed.

      functional          Specify a type of the functional for using the numerical delta method when "NDM"
                            is given for the option approach( ). It must be one of "KS", "L1", and "L2".
                            If the option is not given, "L1" is used as a default option.

      ngrid               Set the number of grid points for calculating test statistics. 100 is set as a
                            default.

      s                   Set the stochastic order of the null hypothesis. 1 is set as a default. It must
                            be a positive integer.

      b1                  Set the number of subsample for the first variable.

      b2                  Set the number of subsample for the second variable.

      nboot               Set the number of bootstrapping.

      c                   Set a value of the tuning parameter for the contact set approach. 0.75 is set as
                            a default value.

      a                   Set a value of the tuning parameter for the selective recentering approach. 0.1
                            is set as a default value.

      eta                 Set a value of the tuning parameter for the selective recentering approach.
                            10e^\{-6\} is set as a default value.

      epsilon             Set a value of the tuning parameter for the numerical delta method. 0.75 is set
                            as a default value.

      alpha               Set the significance level for the statistical test. 0.05 is set as a default
                            value.

Description

    pysdtest performs statistical tests for the null hypothesis of stochastic dominance (SD) that is the
    first sample (variable) s-th order stochastically dominates the second one. s can be set as an
    arbitrary stochastic order.

    Supported testing procedures include, but are not limited to, tests through the least favorable case
    approach of Barrett and Donald (2003), subsampling approach of Linton et al. (2005), contact set
    approach of Linton et al. (2010) and sele recentering method of Donald and Hsu (2016). In addition,
    the numerical delta method (NDM; D\'fcmbgen 1993; Fang and Santos 2019; Hong and Li 2018) can be used to
    compute the critical value.

    pysdtest also supports the combination of various resampling methods, test statistics and procedures
    for approximating the limiting distribution.

    The command is based on the python package PySDTest. Therefore Stata with version higher than 16.0,
    Python 3 software and installation of the Python package are necessary for using the command.

    See Lee and Whang (2024) on arXiv for further reference on concepts/tests of SD and details/guidance
    about using the Stata/Python package.
